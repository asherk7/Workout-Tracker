            The push pull legs workout split is a popular training routine that divides exercises based on muscle groups and movement patterns. In this split, you dedicate one day to pushing exercises (e.g., chest, shoulders, triceps), another day to pulling exercises (e.g., back, biceps), and a third day to leg exercises (e.g., quads, hamstrings, calves). This split allows for optimal muscle recovery while providing balance and targeting specific muscle groups on different training days.        </div>

            The Arnold split, named after the legendary bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, is a variation of the traditional bodybuilding split. It involves working each muscle group twice a week, allowing for increased frequency and volume. The split typically consists of training chest and back on one day, shoulders and arms on another day, and legs separately. The Arnold split aims to provide a comprehensive approach to building overall muscle mass and symmetry.        </div>

            The upper/lower workout split focuses on dividing training days into upper body and lower body workouts. Typically, you will have two upper body days, targeting muscles such as chest, back, shoulders, and arms, and two lower body days, focusing on exercises for legs, including quads, hamstrings, and calves. This split allows for more targeted training of specific muscle groups while providing adequate rest and recovery between workouts.        </div>

            The bro split, also known as the bodybuilder split, is a training routine that focuses on training one muscle group per day throughout the week. This split typically involves training chest, back, shoulders, legs, and arms on separate days, with a day or two dedicated to rest. The bro split allows for intense focus on individual muscle groups and is often used by bodybuilders looking to maximize muscle hypertrophy and aesthetics.        </div>

            The full body workout split involves training all major muscle groups in a single session. This type of workout is usually performed two to three times a week, with each session targeting the entire body. Full body workouts are efficient for those with limited time or beginners looking to establish a foundation of strength and overall fitness. They provide a balanced approach to training and promote overall muscle development.        </div>

            The PPL+Arnold split is a hybrid workout routine that combines elements of the push pull legs (PPL) split and the Arnold split. It typically involves three training days per week, alternating between push, pull, and leg workouts like in the PPL split. However, each workout session incorporates additional exercises for smaller muscle groups, such as arms and shoulders, similar to the Arnold split. This combination aims to provide a well-rounded training approach, focusing on both major muscle groups and specific muscle development.        </div>
